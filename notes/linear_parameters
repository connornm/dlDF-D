Krzysztof - 
- choose a starting set of all parameters, linear and nonlinear
- solve KS equations
- express E(\rho) as a function of linear parameters
- construct and solve least-square equations for {a_i,c_i}
- solve again KS equations using {a_i,c_i} from lsq solution
- iterate to convergence, keeping all nonlinear parameters fixed all the
   time
- feed the final energy to the nonlinear minimization program, get new
   values of nonlinear parameters, and repeat te process using as the
   starting set in KS equations the linear parameters from the previous
   step of the nonlinear process.
